                    CryptoLens is a cryptocurrency market analysis tool that detects trading patterns (Fair Value Gaps, Order Blocks, Liquidity Sweeps) across multiple timeframes and sends notifications based on pattern detection. The Service is provided for informational and educational purposes only.
